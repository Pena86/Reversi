I have started to modify this project to my needs. We have a class about AI's and there are a class work that implements a AI to reversi game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). The class uses java in default, but I prefer python, so I decided to make my own local game server, in where we can develope and compete with our AI's.
We'll see how this plays out...

Dependancies:  
    - Python 3.3.3  
    - PyGame 1.9.2a0

The program is run simply with:

    python main.py

Some key commands at the game:  
    - Quit: Cmd + Q or Ctrl + q  
    - New game: Cmd + N or Ctrl + n

Things that can be improved upon:  
    - The AI is very dumb, it simply goes for the moves that capture the most
